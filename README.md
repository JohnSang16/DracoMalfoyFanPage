<h2>💡 Project Motivation</h2>
This project was built with a dual purpose. On a personal note, I wanted to create a special digital space for my cousin, Emily, whose favorite character is Draco Malfoy. I wanted to capture the aesthetic she loves while highlighting the complexity of Draco's character arc.

On a technical level, I embarked on this project to solidify my mastery of the "Core Three" building blocks of web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While I have experience with frameworks, I believe that returning to these fundamentals is essential for writing cleaner code, understanding the DOM, and creating custom styles without relying on external libraries.
