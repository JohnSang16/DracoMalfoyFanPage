            <div class = "authorQuote">"He's shut down compassion — how else would you become a Death Eater? So he suppresses virtually all of the good side of himself. But then he's playing with the big boys, as the phrase has it, and suddenly, having talked the talk he's asked to walk it for the first time and it is absolutely terrifying. And I think that that is an accurate depiction of how some people fall into that kind of way of life and they realise what they're in for. I felt sorry for Draco. Well, I've always known this was coming for Draco, obviously, however nasty he was."

            <div >Draco Lucius[11] Malfoy (b. 5 June 1980) was a British pure-blood wizard and the only son of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy (née Black). The son of a Death Eater, Draco was raised to strongly believe in the importance of blood purity. He looked down on half-bloods and Muggle-borns.</div>
            <div>Draco attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry from 1991-1998. He was sorted into Slytherin House almost the moment the Sorting Hat touched his head. During his years at Hogwarts, he became friends with Vincent Crabbe, Gregory Goyle, Pansy Parkinson, and other fellow Slytherins, but he quickly developed a rivalry with Harry Potter.</div>
            <div>He was made a prefect of his house and was a member of the Inquisitorial Squad during his fifth year, at the end of which his father was imprisoned in Azkaban following the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. Lord Voldemort charged Draco with making up for Lucius's failure, and he became a Death Eater at age sixteen but quickly became disillusioned and uncomfortable with the lifestyle.</div>
            <div>Draco was unable to complete his task of murdering Albus Dumbledore, which was later taken over by Severus Snape, and only performed his other duties fearfully and reluctantly. He and his family defected hours before the end of the Second Wizarding War, fearing for their lives.</div>
            <div>By 2017, Draco had married Emily Lastname and had one child, Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy.</div>

Both the Malfoys and the Blacks had traditionally been in Slytherin House for centuries and strongly disapproved of any relatives who did not follow in this tradition, such as Sirius Black.[13] His mother sang him a secretive lullaby which had been passed down to the Black family.[14]</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Draco was raised in an atmosphere of regret that Lord Voldemort had not succeeded in taking command of the wizarding community, although he was prudently reminded that such sentiments ought not to be expressed outside the small circle of the family and their close friends 'or Daddy might get into trouble'. The Malfoys were very proud of their Pure-blood and social status; until 1996, they were able to maintain a respectable public image while being allied with Lord Voldemort. Lucius was a Death Eater who avoided imprisonment in Azkaban following the First Wizarding War by claiming that he had been under the Imperius Curse, while Narcissa merely agreed with the ideology of pure-blood supremacy.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Malfoys spoiled their son, giving him the best of everything as far as material possessions go. The only two hand-me-down things Draco ever received were the old family prejudice against Muggles, Muggle-borns, half-breeds, and blood traitors — in short, prejudice against anyone who was not a pure-blood wizardkind or anyone who supports these types of people — and the Malfoy family's vast collection of powerful dark artifacts harking back to the family history.</p>

                    <h4>Preparing for Hogwarts
                    </h4>
                    <p><figure style = "float:left;  margin: 1em 1em .2em 0em;width: 19em; "><img src="Images\Draco_Malfoy_HM.webp" alt="young Draco Malfoy" style="aspect-ratio:2/1; width: 100%; display:block;"><figcaption style = "font-size:15px; color: rgb(149, 129, 202)">A young Draco Malfoy speaking to Jacob's sibling at Hogwarts</figcaption></figure></p>In his childhood, Draco associated mainly with the pure-blood children of his father's ex-Death Eater cronies and therefore arrived at Hogwarts with a small gang of friends already made, including Theodore Nott and Vincent Crabbe.[1] He visited the school himself when Lucius came to inspect, and his father entrusted Jacob's sibling and Merula Snyde to be his chaperones, a decision which did not rub off well with any of the three. Lucius had requested the two in particular, as Jacob's sibling was ostensibly the best student in their year whilst Merula was the daughter of two of Lucius's former Death Eater colleagues and thus considered the 'right' type of person for Draco to associate with. Draco did not endear himself to either student, however, particularly with his snobbish and disdainful attitude towards them and open displays of prejudice.[15]
                    <br>
                    <p>During the visit, Draco stole his father's wand, as he was too young to have his own and wanted to perform magic after seeing Merula perform the Jelly-Legs Curse on Jacob's sibling. Lucius initially blamed the theft on their House-elf Dobby, as the perpetrator knew he kept his wand inside his walking stick, which wasn't common knowledge. Jacob's sibling investigated and returned the wand to Lucius.[16]</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Whilst Lucius was at the Three Broomsticks Inn negotiating a supply of Butterbeer for Malfoy Manor, he brought Draco along, who wanted to go to Honeydukes. When Jacob's sibling attempted to ask Lucius about his wife, Narcissa, they were made the chaperone of Draco again. Draco convinced Jacob's sibling to take him to Honeydukes, with the promise that he would tell Jacob's sibling anything they wanted to know about his mother. Draco eventually ended up telling Jacob's sibling about the Black family lullaby which his mother would sing to him every night, which turned out to be the key to unlocking Narcissa's lock on the Black sisters' keepsake box.[17]</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When it was nearing the time for Draco to attend school, his father wanted him to attend Durmstrang Institute, a school in Northern Europe that taught the Dark Arts and did not admit Muggle-borns. Additionally, he believed that the son of a member of the Hogwarts Board of Governors not attending Hogwarts would be a great scandal and could potentially force Dumbledore to retire. However, Draco's mother did not like the idea of him going to school far away, though ultimately convinced Lucius to make it Draco's choice where he went to school. Lucius attempted to influence his son's decision by bringing him on a surprise inspection of Hogwarts during the 1986–1987 school year, during which he vocally derided the state of the school and Slytherin House in particular to his son and attempted to bribe Draco's chaperone, Jacob's sibling, into influencing Draco's decision. During this visit, Draco got caught up in the investigations into a conspiracy against Slytherin, and helped bring the conspirators to justice. For this, Professor Snape thanked him in front of the whole hall, which made Draco certain he wanted to attend Hogwarts, much to his father's derision. He also revealed that Narcissa had promised him a second birthday cake if he picked Hogwarts. Thus they sent him to Hogwarts.[3][16][18]</p>
